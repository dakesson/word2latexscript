abstract = {In the conceptual design phase, solutions are reached through an iterative, high-paced and often chaotic manner. Conventional advanced structural analysis software is often too advanced and insufficiently agile to follow this high-paced work pattern. Premature use of advanced structural analysis tools can negatively affect conceptual understanding and the quality of the conceptual design. The multi-touch interfaces of today's tablet computers give the user a strong feeling of direct manipulation of objects on the screen. This is interesting for structural mechanics applications, enabling direct manipulation of the structural model on the screen so as to have a better understanding and feeling of the structural behaviour. A tablet computer application for the conceptual design phase, which uses this type of direct manipulation interface, has been developed.},

@article{Alic2015,
abstract = {A method for form finding with dynamic relaxation and Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) based isogeometric membrane elements has been implemented and studied regarding the influence of the discretization and element shape on the form finding. The procedure allows for rapid form finding since NURBS describe the curved geometry well and it is shown that the form-finding can be performed using a coarse mesh. However, to minimize the bending strain energy a fine mesh is needed. Using smaller elements is more advantageous than increasing the degree of the basis functions, keeping the number of integration points few and converging at a lesser number of iterations. Using isogeometric analysis (IGA) simplifies further studies since the form-found shape can be exactly represented with a shell element formulation. The method is suitable to be used in computer aided design environments such as Rhinoceros 3D during design stages, where the form finding can be evaluated together with other studies in a design context.},

abstract = {The development of prestressing technology has constituted one of the more important improvements in the fields of structural engineering and construction. Referring particularly to post-tensioning applications, it is generally recognized how it opens the possibility to improve economy, structural behaviour and aesthetic aspects in concrete solutions.In spite of the simplicity of its basic concepts and well-known advantages, the application extent of post-tensioning solutions cannot be considered harmonized in the different areas and structural applications. In fact, for various reasons, it appears that the potential offered by prestressing is far from being fully exploited, especially in building structures field. In many cases where post-tensioning would provide a visibly superior solution, it happens after all that a more conventional non-prestressed solution is often selected.The main objective of this fib Technical Report is therefore to show the benefits of using post-tensioning for the more common practical applications in concrete buildings. The document is mainly addressed to architects, contractors and owners. It is also drafted with the goal of motivating building designers to use post-tensioning: basic design aspects related to prestressing effects and design criteria are summarized and conceptual design aspects are emphasized.A set of practical examples is presented, showing the adopted solutions and their advantages when meeting the requirements of specific problems. The selected examples were precisely not chosen because they are outstanding structures. As a matter of fact, post-tensioning principles and technology can be used in any structure, independently of its importance, covering a wide range of building structural applications, improving the structure quality and promoting concrete as a structural material.The advantages of using post-tensioning, concerning structural behaviour, economy, detailing and constructive aspects, are illustrated by the presentation of several existing structures, most of them designed by Working Party members. General design calculations are not presented, but design results showing the improvement in structural behaviour are illustrated. },

abstract = {Optimization often focuses only on the variation of parameters while neglecting the consideration of alternative systems. However, the rearrangement of the components of a design offers important scope for improvement. To deal with such variations concerning the system structure of models for multidisciplinary design optimization (MDO), this paper proposes a framework for generating models dynamically using a design grammar with an underlying component-oriented analysis. Decomposition and modification rules support the derivation of alternative optimization model and the formalization of system changes. By linking qualitative characteristics with quantitative analyses, the components serve to assign architectural qualities to economic and environmental resources such as costs and energy consumption and thus to include non-numerical, qualitative characteristics within numerical optimization. The approach is developed with the help of a frame-based hall design and demonstrates system modifications of the optimization model by a specific rule set. The rule set focuses on the structural design but considers the effects for the other essential disciplines involved in the design case. The setup and the prototypical implementation of an optimization model for this design illustrate a way of including grammar-based system variations in MDO.},

abstract = {The field of structural optimization is still a relatively new field undergoing rapid changes in methods and focus. Until recently there was a severe imbalance between the enormous amount of literature on the subject, and the paucity of applications to practical design problems. This imbalance is being gradually redressed. There is still no shortage of new publications, but there are also exciting applications of the methods of structural optimizations in the automotive, aerospace, civil engineering, machine design and other engineering fields. As a result of the growing pace of applications, research into structural optimization methods is increasingly driven by real-life problems. t-.Jost engineers who design structures employ complex general-purpose software packages for structural analysis. Often they do not have any access to the source program, and even more frequently they have only scant knowledge of the details of the structural analysis algorithms used in this software packages. Therefore the major challenge faced by researchers in structural optimization is to develop methods that are suitable for use with such software packages. Another major challenge is the high computational cost associated with the analysis of many complex real-life problems. In many cases the engineer who has the task of designing a structure cannot afford to analyze it more than a handful of times.},

abstract = {Gathering user feedback on provisional design concepts early in the design process has the potential to reduce time-to-market and create more satisfying products. Among the parameters that shape user response to a product, this paper investigates how design experts use sketches, physical prototypes, and computer-aided design (CAD) to generate and represent ideas, as well as how these tools are linked to design attributes and multiple measures of design quality. Eighteen expert designers individually addressed a 2 hr design task using only sketches, foam prototypes, or CAD. It was found that prototyped designs were generated more quickly than those created using sketches or CAD. Analysis of 406 crowdsourced responses to the resulting designs showed that those created as prototypes were perceived as more novel, more aesthetically pleasing, and more comfortable to use. It was also found that designs perceived as more novel tended to fare poorly on all other measured qualities.},

In this paper, we propose the use of particle-spring systems for finding structural forms composing only axial forces. The equilibrium position of each particle is found using a Runge-Kutta solver, which allows the user to interact with the simulation while it is running. Several examples illustrate the technique, beginning with two-dimensional funicular forms and extending to three-dimensional networks. The paper proposes a novel three-dimensional design and analysis tool, which can be used by engineers and architects to find structural forms in real time.},

abstract = {Since the coining of the term ‘serious games' by Clark Abt, practitioners in fields such as education, the military, and medical science, as well as researchers from other disciplines, have investigated with interest game mechanics and the dynamics of games in non-gaming applications. Gaming has extended beyond what was initially its natural boundary of entertainment and is now associated with the process of problem solving while providing analytical questioning of scientific viewpoints through active gameplay. The rules of game interaction or game mechanics include the concepts of usability and playability which are focused in a less complex environment which provides a more intuitive user experience (UX). In the process of CAD development and applications the effective use and support of the user's perception and their UX have been compromised by the engineering design system's functionality and step-by-step evolution. This article reviews gaming techniques and mechanisms that may potentially be beneficial to the future development of CAD systems in engineering, in particular to maintain cognitive engagement. In light of this, the article focuses on the fundamental activity of engineering using CAD systems with particular attention on CAD graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and how they can be potentially enhanced using game mechanics to provide more engaging and intuitive environments.},

abstract = {he paper discusses how courses in mechanics can be taught to architectural students in such a way that concepts are presented to them in a manner making mechanics an inspiration for the designing process rather than simply imposing limitations on it. In courses of this sort that have been held, emphasis has been placed on the use of software to facilitate an intuitive understanding of physical relationships in the area of mechanics, as well as on transforming such an understanding into design sketches. ForcePAD, a readily comprehensible software package of this sort developed for making schematic 2D sketches and investigating different patterns in the area of mechanics, is presented. Originally, it was developed as a tool for providing a basic introduction to mechanics for students of civil engineering. The package aims at enhancing an understanding of such factors as balance, weight, stability, rest and movement, support forces, stress fields, and deformation. The paper is based on experience with classes taught both at Lund University and at Chalmers University in Gothenburg that have made use of this package (Olsson, 2003). The types of weekly tasks students have been given, as well as how the educational conceptions utilized in these courses have influenced the design of the ForcePad software, are discussed.},

abstract = {The authors obtain graphical rules to construct discrete optimum structures without the use of analytical or numerical optimization processes. Structures investigated are limited to those having a single loaded point and two points of support (three-point problems). The cost of structures is assumed to be proportional to their theoretical weight and to a performance index. The performance index is derived using the Lagrange multiplier method to minimize deflection of the loaded point with the given total volume of material. Solutions of simple problems, obtained with a gradient-based minimizing procedure, lead through a series of observations to the generalized solution of optimum discrete structures. The authors determine that optimum discrete structure for three-point problems can be described using the angles between four truss elements connected in every non-support node. These four angles are the same for every node of the structure.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the need to consider both quantitative performance goals and qualitative requirements in conceptual design. A new computational approach for design space exploration is proposed that extends existing interactive evolutionary algorithms for increased inclusion of designer preferences, overcoming the weaknesses of traditional optimization that have limited its use in practice. This approach allows designers to set the evolutionary parameters of mutation rate and generation size, in addition to parent selection, in order to steer design space exploration. This paper demonstrates the potential of this approach through a numerical parametric study, a software implementation, and series of case studies.},

@article{Ramani2015,
abstract = {The advent of depth cameras has enabled mid-air interactions for shape modeling with bare hands. Typically, these interactions employ a finite set of pre-defined hand gestures to allow users to specify modeling operations in virtual space. However, human interactions in real world shaping processes (such as pottery or sculpting) are complex, iterative, and continuous. In this paper, we show that the expression of user intent in shaping processes can be derived from the geometry of contact between the hand and the manipulated object. Specifically, we describe the design and evaluation of a geometric interaction technique for bare-hand mid-air virtual pottery. We model the shaping of a pot as a gradual and progressive convergence of the pot's profile to the shape of the user's hand represented as a point-cloud (PCL). Thus, a user does not need to learn, know, or remember any gestures to interact with our system. Our choice of pottery simplifies the geometric representation, allowing us to systematically study how users use their hands and fingers to express the intent of deformation during a shaping process. Our evaluations demonstrate that it is possible to enable users to express their intent for shape deformation without the need for a fixed set of gestures for clutching and deforming a shape.},

abstract = {Scheduling, routing, and layout tasks are examples of hard optimization problems with broad application in industry. Past research in this area has focused on algorithmic issues. However, this approach neglects many important human-computer interaction issues that must be addressed to provide people with practical solutions to optimization problems. Automatic methods do not leverage human expertise and can only find solutions that are optimal with regard to an invariably over-simplified problem description. Furthermore, users must understand the generated solutions in order to implement, justify, or modify them. Interactive optimization helps address these issues but has not previously been studied in detail. This paper describes experiments on an interactive optimization system that explore the most appropriate way to combine the respective strengths of people and computers. Our results show that users can successfully identify promising areas of the search space as well as manage the amount of computational effort expended on different subproblems},

abstract = {Real-time physics simulation has been extensively used in computer games, but its potential has yet to be fully realized in design and education. We present an interactive 3D physics engine with a wide variety of applications. In common with traditional FEM, the use of a local element stiffness matrix is retained. However, unlike typical non-linear FEM routines elements forces, moments and inertia are appropriately lumped at nodes following the dynamic relaxation method. A semi-implicit time integration scheme updates linear and angular momentum, and subsequently the local coordinate frames of the nodes. A co-rotational approach is used to compute the resultant field of displacements in global coordinates including the effect of large deformations. The results obtained compare well against established commercial software. We demonstrate that the method presented allows the making of interactive structural models that can be used in teaching to develop an intuitive understanding of structural behaviour. We also show that the same interactive physics framework allows real-time optimization that can be used for geometric and structural design applications.},

abstract = {Shape annealing, a computational design method applied to structural design, has been extended to the design of tra; elegance. In contrast to deterministic structural optimization methods, shape annealing, a stochastic method, uses lateral exploration to generate multiple designs of similar quality that form a structural language of solutions. Structural languages can serve to enhance designer creativity by presenting multiple, spatially innovative, yet functional design solutions while also providing insight into the interaction between structural form and the trade-offs involved in multiobjective design. The style of the structures within a language is a product of the shape grammar that defines the allowable structural forms and the optimization model that provides a functional measure of the generated forms to determine the desirable designs. This paper presents an application of geodesic dome patterns that have been embodied in a shape grammar to define a structural language of domes. Within this language of domes, different dome styles are generated by changing the optimization model for dome design to include the design goals of maximum enclosure space, minimum surface area, minimum number of distinct cross-sectional areas, and visual uniformity. The strengths of the method that will be shown are 1) the generation of both conventional domes similar to shape optimization results and spatially innovative domes, 2) the generation of design alternatives within a defined design style, and 3) the generation of different design styles by modifying the language semantics provided by the optimization model.},

@book{Timoshenko1953,
abstract = {Strength of materials is that branch of engineering concerned with the deformation and disruption of solids when forces other than changes in position or equilibrium are acting upon them. The development of our understanding of the strength of materials has enabled engineers to establish the forces which can safely be imposed on structure or components, or to choose materials appropriate to the necessary dimensions of structures and components which have to withstand given loads without suffering effects deleterious to their proper functioning. This excellent historical survey of the strength of materials with many references to the theories of elasticity and structures is based on an extensive series of lectures delivered by the author at Stanford University, Palo Alto, California. Timoshenko explores the early roots of the discipline from the great monuments and pyramids of ancient Egypt through the temples, roads, and fortifications of ancient Greece and Rome. The author fixes the formal beginning of the modern science of the strength of materials with the publications of Galileo's book, "Two Sciences," and traces the rise and development as well as industrial and commercial applications of the fledgling science from the seventeenth century through the twentieth century. Timoshenko fleshes out the bare bones of mathematical theory with lucid demonstrations of important equations and brief biographies of highly influential mathematicians, including: Euler, Lagrange, Navier, Thomas Young, Saint-Venant, Franz Neumann, Maxwell, Kelvin, Rayleigh, Klein, Prandtl, and many others. These theories, equations, and biographies are further enhanced by clear discussions of the development of engineering and engineering education in Italy, France, Germany, England, and elsewhere. 245 figures.},

Well-known methods such as the force density method, dynamic relaxation, updated reference strategy and others are discussed by mathematically structuring and presenting them in the same way, using the same notation and combining terminology. Based on this, a single computational framework using a sparse branch-node data structure is presented. It is shown how each method approaches the initial equilibrium problem, defines and linearizes the equilibrium equations applied to linear elements, and uses particular solving strategies. This framework marginalizes any differences related to operating platforms, programming language and style, offering a better baseline for independent comparison of performance and results. As a consequence, it is possible to more clearly relate, distinguish and compare existing methods, allow for hybrid methods and identify new avenues for research. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

@book{MadeByRobots,
abstract = {In the next decade or so, the widespread adoption of robotics is set to transform the construction industry: building techniques will become increasingly automated both on- and off-site, dispensing with manual labour and enabling greater cost and operational efficiencies. What unique opportunities, however, does robotics afford beyond operational effectiveness explicitly for the practice of architecture? What is the potential for the serial production of non-standard elements as well as for varied construction processes? In order to scale up and advance the application of robotics, for both prefabrication and on-site construction, there needs to be an understanding of the different capabilities, and these should be considered right from the start of the design and planning process. This issue of AD showcases the findings of the Architecture and Digital Fabrication research module at the ETH Zurich Future Cities Laboratory in Singapore, directed by Fabio Gramazio and Matthias Kohler, which explores the possibilities of robotic construction processes for architecture and their large-scale application to the design and construction of high-rise buildings. Together with other contributors, such as Philippe Morel, Neri Oxman, Fran{\c{c}}ois Roche and Antoine Picon, they also look at the far-reaching transformations starting to occur within automated fabrication: in terms of liberation of labour, entrepreneurship, the changing shape of building sites, in-situ fabrication and, most significantly, design. Contributors: Thomas Bock, Jelle Feringa, Philippe Morel, Neri Oxman, Antoine Picon and Fran{\c{c}}ois Roche. ETH Zurich contributors: Michael Budig, Norman Hack, Willi Lauer and Jason Lim and Raffael Petrovic (Future Cities Laboratory), Volker Helm, Silke Langenberg and Jan Willmann. Featured entrepreneurs: Greyshed, Machineous, Odico Formwork Robotics, RoboFold and ROB Technologies.},
